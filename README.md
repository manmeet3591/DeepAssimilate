# deepassimilate

**deepassimilate** is a modular framework for training **unconditional diffusion models** and applying them to **generative data assimilation (DA)**.  
It is built on **PyTorch** and **Hugging Face Diffusers**, and is designed for scientific machine learning, inverse problems, physical sciences, weather/climate modeling, and uncertainty quantification workflows.


# Cookbooks

1. Use all the different models in deepassimilate 

2. Train unconditional diffusion model with one of the sample models in deepassimilate. Training diffusion priors on weather/ocean datasets

3. Station observations to gridded xarray

4. Zero shot data assimilation of station observations to gridded data
